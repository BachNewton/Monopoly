    def build_houses(self, game_state, player):

        Called near the start of the player's turn to give the option of building houses.

        Return a list of tuples indicating which properties you want to build houses
        on and how many houses to build on each. For example:
        [(park_lane, 3), (mayfair, 4)]

        The properties should be Property objects.

        Return an empty list if you do not want to build.

        Notes:
        - You must own a whole set of unmortgaged properties before you can
          build houses on it.

        - You can build on multiple sets in one turn. Just specify all the streets
          and houses you want to build.

        - Build five houses on a property to have a "hotel".

        - You specify the _additional_ houses you will be building, not the
          total after building. For example, if Park Lane already has 3 houses
          and you specify (park_lane, 2) you will end up with 5
          houses (ie, a hotel).

        - Sets must end up with 'balanced' housing. No square in a set can
          have more than one more house than any other. If you request an
          unbalanced build, the whole transaction will be rolled back, even
          if it includes balanced building on other sets as well.

        - If you do not have (or cannot raise) enough money to build all the
          houses specified, the whole transaction will be rolled back. Between
          this function call and money being taken, you will have an opportunity
          to mortgage properties or make deals.

        The default behaviour is not to build.

        This is called when any debt, fine or rent has to be paid. It is

        Notes:
        - You cannot mortgage properties with houses on them, so if you
          plan to mortgage, make sure you sell all the houses first.

        - For each house sold you receive half the price that they were
          bought for.

        - Houses on a set must end up 'balanced', ie no property can have
          more than one more house than any other property in the set.

        Return a list of tuples of the streets and number of houses you
        want to sell. For example:
        [(old_kent_road, 1), (bow_street, 1)]

        - You receive half the face value of each property mortgaged.

        - You cannot mortgage properties with houses on them.
          (The AI will have been given the option to sell houses before this

        Unmortgaging costs half the face value plus 10%. Between deciding
        to unmortgage and money being taken the player will be given the
        opportunity to make deals or sell other properties. If after this
        they do not have enough money, the whole transaction will be aborted,
        and no properties will be unmortgaged and no money taken.

        Return a list of property names to unmortgage, like:
        [old_kent_road, bow_street]

        The properties should be Property objects.

        PlayerAIBase.Action.PLAY_GET_OUT_OF_JAIL_FREE_CARD
        PlayerAIBase.Action.STAY_IN_JAIL

        Buying your way out of jail will cost Â£50.

    def propose_deal(self, game_state, player):
        '''
        Called to allow the player to propose a deal.

        You return a DealProposal object.

        If you do not want to make a deal, return None.

        If you want to make a deal, you provide this information:
        - The player number of the player you are proposing the deal to
        - A list of properties offered
        - A list of properties wanted
        - Maximum cash offered as part of the deal
        - Minimum cash wanted as part of the deal.

        Properties offered and properties wanted are passed as lists of
        Property objects.

        If you offer money as part of the deal, set the cash wanted to zero
        and vice versa.

        Note that the cash limits will not be shown to the proposed-to player.
        When the deal is offered to them, they set their own limits for accepting
        the deal without seeing your limits. If the limits are acceptable to both
        players, the deal will be done at the halfway point.

        For example, Player1 proposes:
          Propose to: Player2
          Properties offered: Mayfair
          Properties wanted: (none)
          Maximum cash offered: 0
          Minimum cash wanted: 500

        Player2 accepts with these limits:
          Maximum cash offered: 1000
          Minimum cash wanted: 0

        The deal will be done with Player2 receiving Mayfair and paying Â£750
        to Player1.

        The only 'negotiation' is in the managing of cash along with the deal
        as discussed above. There is no negotiation about which properties are
        part of the deal. If a deal is rejected because it does not contain the
        right properties, another deal can be made at another time with different
        lists of properties.

        Example construction and return of a DealProposal object:
            return DealProposal(
                propose_to_player_number=2,
                properties_offered=[vine_street, bow_street],
                properties_wanted=[park_lane],
                maximum_cash_offered=200)
