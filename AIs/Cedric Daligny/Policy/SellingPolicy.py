        Notes:
        - You receive half the face value of each property mortgaged.

        - You cannot mortgage properties with houses on them.
          (The AI will have been given the option to sell houses before this
          function is called.)

        Return a list of properties to mortgage, for example:
        [bow_street, liverpool_street_station]

        The properties should be Property objects.

        Return an empty list if you do not want to mortgage anything.

        The default behaviour is not to mortgage anything.

        Notes:
        - You cannot mortgage properties with houses on them, so if you

          bought for.

          more than one more house than any other property in the set.

    def propose_deal(self,game_state,player):
        '''
        Called to allow the player to propose a deal.

        You return a DealProposal object.

        If you do not want to make a deal, return None.

        If you want to make a deal, you provide this information:
        - The player number of the player you are proposing the deal to
        - A list of properties offered
        - A list of properties wanted
        - Maximum cash offered as part of the deal
        - Minimum cash wanted as part of the deal.

        Properties offered and properties wanted are passed as lists of
        Property objects.

        If you offer money as part of the deal, set the cash wanted to zero
        and vice versa.

        Note that the cash limits will not be shown to the proposed-to player.
        When the deal is offered to them, they set their own limits for accepting
        the deal without seeing your limits. If the limits are acceptable to both
        players, the deal will be done at the halfway point.

        For example, Player1 proposes:
          Propose to: Player2
          Properties offered: Mayfair
          Properties wanted: (none)
          Maximum cash offered: 0
          Minimum cash wanted: 500

        Player2 accepts with these limits:
          Maximum cash offered: 1000
          Minimum cash wanted: 0

        The deal will be done with Player2 receiving Mayfair and paying Â£750
        to Player1.

        The only 'negotiation' is in the managing of cash along with the deal
        as discussed above. There is no negotiation about which properties are
        part of the deal. If a deal is rejected because it does not contain the
        right properties, another deal can be made at another time with different
        lists of properties.

        Example construction and return of a DealProposal object:
            return DealProposal(
                propose_to_player_number=2,
                properties_offered=[vine_street, bow_street],
                properties_wanted=[park_lane],
                maximum_cash_offered=200)

        The default is for no deal to be proposed.
        '''
        return None
