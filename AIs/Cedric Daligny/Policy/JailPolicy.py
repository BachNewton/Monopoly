        Called in the player's turn, before the dice are rolled, if the player
        is in jail.

        There are three possible return values:
        PlayerAIBase.Action.BUY_WAY_OUT_OF_JAIL
        PlayerAIBase.Action.PLAY_GET_OUT_OF_JAIL_FREE_CARD
        PlayerAIBase.Action.STAY_IN_JAIL

        Buying your way out of jail will cost Â£50.

        The default action is STAY_IN_JAIL.
