class Daddy(PlayerAIBase):
    '''
    An AI that plays like a dad (or at least, like I play when
    I'm playing with my children).

    - It initially buys any properties it can.
    - If it runs out of money it will mortgage properties to be
      able to try to complete a set or build houses.
    - It makes favourable deals with other players.
