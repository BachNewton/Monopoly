# TODO: What happen if a deal transfers a property with houses on it,
        but not the whole set?


- Add logging for mortgaging etc


- graphs of cash and 'net worth'


Data sent to the GUI
--------------------

- Should we send the logs?
  - Why not?

- Main thing is the board, though and the game state
  - Who owns each square
  - How many houses on each square
  - Net worth of each player

- What will the GUI show?
  - The board
  - We can assign colours to the players and show the colour
    on each square owned by that player
  - Houses
  - Where each player is
  - Whether the player is in jail

- How often should we send updates?
  - At the end of each turn

- How do we send player info?
  - Identified by player name would be best.
  - But will this repeat the player name too much
    - Not that that is a huge problem.
  - All data can be keyed by player?

- Maybe assign each player a number at the start of the game
  - send a message at the start with player_number -> name dictionary
  - GUI can assign colors

- Each turn
  - We send the Board
    - [(square_number, owner_number, mortgaged, number_of_houses)]
  - We send player info
    - [(player_number, net-worth)]

- We need a start-of-game signal to tell the graphs to reset.

- ZMQ has the annoying feature of missing startup messages.
  - So we need to make sure that
