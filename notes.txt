    In Monopyly you go bankrupt if you do not have enough cash to pay rent or a fine.
    It is your responsibility to sell houses, mortgage properties or make deals to
    raise cash. The framework will not do this for you.

# TODO: What happen if a deal transfers a property with houses on it,
        but not the whole set?


- Add logging for mortgaging etc


- test that events are raised to the AIs, e.g. start of turn etc

- All calls to the AI should be surrounded with try...catch

- What do we do if the AI passes back an unexpected type of object?
  - We need to avoid the game blowing up.
  - Look at: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/typecheck
  - OR: maybe this is just caught with the try-catch thing.

- graphs of cash and 'net worth'
